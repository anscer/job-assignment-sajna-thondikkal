* Here I have implemented CRUD operations for view state,create, update, delete different states.
* i have created users model for storing users information
* I have created role model for storing different roles like admin,maintanence engineer etc.
* Here I have implemented role based security 
* First login using username and passwords.
* Then you would get a token. 
* only 'maintenance_engineer' can do create state,update state, and delete state.
* any other persons can only view all states.
